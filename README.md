# IPL Data Analysis Using Apache Spark

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket data using Apache Spark, a robust open-source unified analytics engine. The main goal of this project is to uncover valuable insights and trends within the IPL datasets by leveraging Spark's capabilities for large-scale data processing.

## Project Objectives
1. Data Ingestion and Cleaning: Efficiently load and preprocess raw IPL data to ensure it is ready for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generate descriptive statistics and visualizations to identify underlying patterns in the data.
3. Advanced Analytics: Implement advanced analytical techniques to derive meaningful insights from the data, such as player performance, team strategies, and match outcomes.
4. Visualization: Create both interactive and static visualizations to effectively present the findings.

## Datasets
The datasets used in this project include IPL match and ball-by-ball data up to the year 2017. You can access the datasets from the following link:

- [IPL Data Till 2017] : https://data.world/raghu543/ipl-data-till-2017

## Technologies Used
- Apache Spark (PySpark): Used for large-scale data processing and analysis.
- Databricks: A cloud-based platform to run Apache Spark and manage the project.
- SparkSQL: Utilized for querying and manipulating structured data.
- Pandas: For additional data manipulation and analysis tasks.
- Matplotlib: To create static visualizations for data representation.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the raw IPL datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with detailed steps for data ingestion, EDA, advanced analytics, and visualization.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts used for various data processing tasks.
- `visualizations/`: Contains static and interactive visualizations generated during the analysis.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions (this file).

## Usage
1. Data Ingestion: Load the IPL datasets into Apache Spark using PySpark.
2. Data Cleaning: Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to explore player performances, team statistics, and match outcomes.
4. Advanced Analytics: Use advanced techniques like clustering, classification, and regression to extract deeper insights.
5. Visualization: Generate and analyze visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
